# spwn-bmp
Converts BMP images to (pixel) objects using SPWN. Its recommended use is for helping with creating pixel art since creating with small / scaled down objects can be very difficult in the editor. Any size BMP is supported but large ones may be *very* slow.

Any format of BMP should also be supported however some may cause some bugs to arise.

## How to use
Import the library like:
```SPWN
import 
```
